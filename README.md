A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure composed of nodes.

 Each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.

Binary Digits (Bits): The smallest unit of data in binary code is a bit, representing a single binary digit (0 or 1).
 Eight bits together form a byte.

Base-2 Number System: Binary is a base-2 numeral system.
 In contrast, the decimal system (used in everyday life) is a base-10 system.
 This means that binary uses powers of 2 to represent numbers.

Representation: 
In binary, each position in a number represents a power of 2. 
For instance, the rightmost bit is 2^0, the next is 2^1, then 2^2, and so on.

Conversion to Other Number Systems:

Decimal:
 Binary numbers can be converted to decimal by adding the decimal values of the positions where there's a '1'.
Hexadecimal:
 Binary numbers are often grouped into sets of four bits (called a nibble) and then converted to hexadecimal for brevity in representation.
